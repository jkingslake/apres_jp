Owing to their role in helping to control the ice sheet contribution to sea level change there is great interest in measuring the rate at which they are melting into the ocean. This study describes the development and deployment of an ice-penetrating phase-sensitive FMCW radar, sufficiently robust and with sufficiently low-power consumption to be run through the Antarctic winter as a standalone instrument, yet with the stability and mm-precision needed to detect the very slow changes in ice shelf thickness in this exceptionally demanding environment. A number of elegant processing techniques are described to achieve reliable, high-precision performance and results presented on field data obtained from the Larsen-C ice shelf, Antarctica.},

	abstract={Many observations regarding grain growth in ice sheets are glaciologically interesting but imperfectly understood. Here we develop the theory of grain growth in ice that is not deforming rapidly, and in the succeeding paper we use this theory to explain observations from glacial ice. In the absence of significant strain energy, the driving force for grain growth arises from grain-boundary curvature. Grain growth is slowed by the interaction of grain boundaries with extrinsic materials (microparticles, bubbles, and dissolved impurities). If the driving force for growth is not large enough to cause boundaries to separate from an extrinsic material, then the grain-boundary velocity is determined by the velocity characteristic of the extrinsic material (low-velocity regime). If the driving force is large enough to cause separation, then boundaries migrate more rapidly than the extrinsic material (high-velocity regime) but the net driving force is reduced through transient pinning by the extrinsic material. Polar ice is typically in the low-velocity regime relative to dissolved impurities and the high-velocity regime relative to microparticles and bubbles. Cross-sectional area of grains is predicted to increase linearly with time under most but not all circumstances.},

From the observations of the rotation of c-axes of individual grains in thin specimens, an empirical equation was obtained for describing the rotation process of c-axes. Combined with another empirical equation on the relationship between the uniaxial strain of whole specimen and the uniaxial strain in individual grains of different c-axis direction, an equation was derived which describes the formation of single maximum fabric in bulk ice samples.Computer simulation of the formation process was performed based on an equation starting from an artificially made random fabric pattern. From the results obtained by a stepwise simulation of 2% strain intervals, the degree of concentration expressed by θm, the angle which halves the number of grains in the fabric diagram is correlated with the accumulated strain in bulk ice (Fig. 8). The strain deduced by applying this relationship to the obtained θm for samples of Dye-3 ice core coincided well with actual strain which the samples had experienced. This implies that the equation is valid and the mechanism of c-axis rotation prevails in polar ice sheets.},

  abstract = {Radar data (center frequency 150 MHz) collected on the Antarctic plateau near the EPICA deep-drilling site in Dronning Maud Land vary systematically in backscattered power, depending on the azimuth antenna orientation. Backscatter extrema are aligned with the principal directions of surface strain rates and change with depth. In the upper 900m, backscatter is strongest when the antenna polarization is aligned in the direction of maximal compression, while below 900 m the maxima shift by 90° pointing towards the lateral flow dilatation. We investigate the backscatter from elongated air bubbles and a vertically varying crystal-orientation fabric (COF) using different scattering models in combination with ice-core data. We hypothesize that short-scale variations in COF are the primary mechanism for the observed anisotropy, and the 900 m boundary between the two regimes is caused by ice with varying impurity content. Observations of this kind allow the deduction of COF variations with depth and are potentially also suited to map the transition between Holocene and glacial ice.},

  abstract = {Crystal-orientation fabric (COF) has a large influence on ice-sheet flow. Earlier radar studies have shown that COF-based birefringence occurs within ice sheets. Radio-wave scattering in polar ice results from changing physical properties of permittivity and conductivity that arise from differing values of density, acidity and COF. We present an improved mathematical model that can handle all these phenomena together. We use this matrix-based model to study the two-way propagation of depolarized radio waves that scatter at both isotropic and anisotropic boundaries. Based on numerical simulations, we demonstrate how COF affects the radar signals in terms of radar polarization and frequency. We then compare the simulated features with VHF radar data obtained at two contrasting inland sites in East Antarctica, where COF is known from ice-core studies. These two sites are Dome Fuji, located near a dome summit, and Mizuho, located in a converging ice-flow region. Data at Dome Fuji are dominated by typical features resulting from birefringence. In contrast, both birefringence and anisotropic scattering affect the radar data at Mizuho. We argue that radar methods can be used to determine principal axes and strength of birefringence in the ice sheets.},

  abstract = {Radio-echo observations have shown that polar ice in situ is birefringent. The most likely explanation of the birefringence is an anisotropy in the radio-frequency dielectric constant of the ice single crystal, combined with the ordering of the orientations of the ice crystals in polar ice. It is possible to calculate the birefringence of ice which has a distribution of crystal orientations using a technique similar to that used to derive the dielectric properties of heterogeneous media. The experimentally observed birefringence may then be shown to be consistent with the crystal orientation fabric at the site of the observations if the anisotropy of the dielectric constant is slightly less than 1\%, that is, slightly less than the accuracy of the laboratory measurements which have failed to detect any anisotropy. Further experimental observations might be used to obtain information on not only the level of anisotropy of the single crystal but also on the crystal orientation fabric of the ice., RésuméLes observations de radio-écho-sondage ont montré que la glace polaire in situ est biréfringente. L’explication la plus plausible de cette biréfringence repose sur l’existence d’une anisotropie des constantes diélectriques des monocristaux de glace aux fréquences radio, combinée à une orientation ordonnée des cristaux de glace dans la glace polaire. Il est possible de calculer la biréfringence de la glace possèdant une distribution des orientations cristallines, en utilisant une technique similaire à celle utilisée pour obtenir les propriétés diélectriques des milieux hétérogènes. On peut alors montrer que la biréfringence observée expérimentalement est en accord avec la texture d’orientation à l’endroit de l’observation si l’anisotropie des constantes diélectriques est un peu moins de 1\%. Celte valeur est quelques peu inférieure à la précision des mesures des laboratoires qui n’ont pas réussi à détecter une quelconque anisotropie. La poursuite de telles observations expérimentales pourraient être utilisées pour obtenir des informations, non seulement sur le niveau de l’anisotropie du monocristal mais aussi sur la texture d’orientation de la glace., ZusammenfassungRadarecho-Untersuchungen haben gezeigt, dass Polareis in situ doppelbrechend ist. Die wahrscheinlichste Erklärung der Doppelbrechung ist eine Anisotropie der Dielektrizitätskonstanten des einkristallinen Eises bei Radarfrequenzen, verbunden mit einer Ausrichtung der Eiskristalle im Polaires. Die Doppelbrechung von Eis mit verteilten Kristallrichtungen kann man mit Hilfe eines Verfahrens berechnen, das dem Verfahren für die Ableitung der dielektrischen Eigenschaften heterogener Stoffe ähnlich ist. Es kann dann gezeigt werden, dass die experimentell beobachtete Doppelbrechung mit dem Kristallorientierungsgefüge an der Beobachtungsstelle übereinstimmt, wenn die Anisotropie der dielektrischen Konstanten knapp unter 1\% ist. Dies ist knapp unter der Genauigkeit der Labormessungen, die keinerlei Anisotropie feststellen konnten.

  abstract = {Glaciers, ice sheets and ice caps represent tectonic systems driven by gravity. Their movement can be studied in real time and the rheological properties and strength of ice determined from laboratory experiments and field measurements. All glacial ice has primary stratification, exhibited by variations in grain size, bubble content and debris content. As it deforms, with deformation dominated by plastic flow and recrystallization, accompanied locally by fracture under tension, a suite of structures develops that reflects the primary fabric of the ice and the anisotropy that develops as a result of cumulative deformation. Initial variations in solid impurity content and strain dependent anisotropy as a result of a crystallographic fabric give rise to effective viscosity increases or decreases compared to isotropic polycrystalline ice of about a factor of ten. Foliation develops from inherited (mostly stratification) or introduced (mostly ice veins or fracture traces) fabric elements and from dynamic recrystallization. It is largely dependent on the accumulated strain, which is highest at the base and near the margins of glaciers, ice sheets and ice streams. Folds develop largely passively due to initial amplification of irregularities in the primary stratification, to variations in flow with time or to inhomogeneous flow associated with shear zones and ductile accommodation around open fractures. Buckle folds and boudinage, mostly on a small scale, occur where viscosity contrast is large, mostly in basal ice. Thrusting and wrench faulting are documented in surging glaciers but theoretically most unlikely and rare or absent elsewhere. Many structures interpreted as faults are not due to shear failure but rather result from shear displacements during opening and closing of tensile fractures.},

  abstract = {The Askaryan Radio Array (ARA) experiment at the South Pole is designed to detect high-energy neutrinos which, via in-ice interactions, produce coherent radiation at frequencies up to 1000 MHz. Characterization of ice birefringence, and its effect upon wave polarization, is proposed to enable range estimation to a neutrino interaction and hence aid in neutrino energy reconstruction. Using radio transmitter calibration sources, the ARA collaboration recently measured polarization-dependent time delay variations and reported significant time delays for trajectories perpendicular to ice flow, but not parallel. To explain these observations, and assess the capability for range estimation, we use fabric data from the SPICE ice core to model ice birefringence and construct a bounding radio propagation model that predicts polarization time delays. We compare the model with new data from December 2018 and demonstrate that the measurements are consistent with the prevailing horizontal crystallographic axis aligned near-perpendicular to ice flow. The study supports the notion that range estimation can be performed for near flowperpendicular trajectories, although tighter constraints on fabric orientation are desirable for improving the accuracy of estimates.},

Owing to the sparseness of ice cores in regions away from the ice divide, we currently lack information about the spatial distribution of ice fabrics and its association with ice flow. Radio-wave reflections are influenced by ice-crystal alignments, allowing them to be tracked provided reflections are recorded simultaneously in orthogonal orientations (polarimetric measurements). Here, we image spatial variations in the thickness and extent of ice fabric across Dome A in East Antarctica, by interpreting polarimetric radar data. We identify four prominent fabric units, each several hundred metres thick, extending over hundreds of square kilometres. By tracing internal ice-sheet layering to the Vostok ice core, we are able to determine the approximate depth–age profile at Dome A. The fabric units correlate with glacial–interglacial cycles, most noticeably revealing crystal alignment contrasts between the Eemian and the glacial episodes before and after. The anisotropy within these fabric layers has a spatial pattern determined by ice flow over subglacial topography.},

  abstract = {The bulk crystal orientation in ice influences the flow of glaciers and ice streams. The ice c-axes fabric is most reliably derived from ice cores. Because these are sparse, the spatial and vertical distribution of the fabric in the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets is largely unknown. In recent years, methods have been developed to determine fabric characteristics from polarimetric radar measurements. The aim of this paper is to present an improved method to infer the horizontal fabric asymmetry by precisely determining the travel-time difference using co-polarised phase-sensitive radar data. We applied this method to six radar measurements from the East Greenland Ice-core Project (EastGRIP) drill site on Greenland's largest ice stream to give a proof of concept by comparing the results with the horizontal asymmetry of the bulk crystal anisotropy derived from the ice core. This comparison shows an excellent agreement, which is a large improvement compared to previously used methods. Our approach is particularly useful for determining the vertical profile of the fabric asymmetry in higher resolution and over larger depths than was achievable with previous methods, especially in regions with strong asymmetry.},
