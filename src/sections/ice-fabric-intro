Ice fabric (also known as crystal-orientation fabric (COF), lattice preferred orientation(LPO), and texture) refers to the bulk pattern of the orientation of c-axis of individual crystals in an ice body :cite:p:`azumaFormationProcessesIce1985`. Ice fabric both records a history of strain and affects ice viscosity (“softness”), and so is of great interest to the ice modeling community. It has also been shown to relate to climactic variables, and can affect the (modeled) age-depth relationship in ice cores [REF].

Ice fabric has been studied almost as long as glaciers have been. See, for example, early studies like those of :cite:t:`perutzMechanismGlacierFlow1940`, which examined crystaline ice fabric from and surficial folds on Alpen glaciers as a way of beginning to understand the mechanics of ice flow.

At the surface of fresh snow fall, the ice fabric is generally isotropic—the c-axes are oriented randomly. However, bulk orientation at deposition (and after deposition, on the surface) may be affected by climactic variables :cite:p:`wangSummitEastAntarctic2018,drewsPotentialMechanismsAnisotropy2012`, like wind and impurity content. This is the cause of anisotropic scattering—scattering resulting from the slight changes in crystal orientation (which are effectively, slight changes in the dielectric constant) between ice layers). 

After deposition, ice fabric develops by: 

1. stress, 
2. grain growth, and 
3. dynamic recrystallization.:cite:p:`azumaFormationProcessesIce1985`
   
For ice fabric generated by stress (1), ice primarily deforms via slip along the crystallographic basal plane :cite:p:`alleyGrainGrowthPolarI1986, hudlestonStructuresFabricsGlacial2015`. In practice, this means ice crystal c-axes (perpendicular to the hexagonal plane) rotate to align with the direction of compression.

Ice crystals are hexagonal and have uniaxial birefringence, and thus their dielectric permittivity can be described by:

$$
\epsilon_{p} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_{\perp} & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \epsilon_{\perp} & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \epsilon_{\parallel} 
\end{pmatrix}
$$

where $\epsilon_{\perp}$ and $\epsilon_{\parallel}$ describe the permittivities perpendicular and parallel to the c-axis, respectively. Birefringence is defined as $\Delta\epsilon'=\epsilon_{\parallel} - \epsilon_{\perp}$. Dielectric permittivities depend on temperature :cite:p:`fujitaSummaryComplexDielectric2000` and frequency, and birefringence changes with both as well.

Ice fabric measurements are represented by an index ellipsoid, where the eigenvalues $\lambda_1$, $\lambda_2$, and $\lambda_3$ represent the relative “c-axis concentration along each principle coordinate direction”, $\lambda_{1}+\lambda_{2}+\lambda_3=1$ and $\lambda_3>\lambda_2>\lambda_1$. This relates the fabric/geometry to the birefringent properties of individual crystals. The bulk dielectric tensor of ice can be represented as: 

$$
\epsilon_{bulk} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
\epsilon_{\perp}+\lambda_1\Delta\epsilon' & 0 & 0 \\
0 & \epsilon_{\perp}+\lambda_2\Delta\epsilon' & 0 \\
0 & 0 & \epsilon_{\perp}+\lambda_3\Delta\epsilon' \end{pmatrix}
$$

:cite:p:`fujitaRadiowaveDepolarizationScattering2006`.

Some common/end-state fabrics include:

Isotropic fabrics: $\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}=\lambda_3=1/3$
Single pole/cluster: $\lambda_{1}=\lambda_{2}=0; \lambda_3=1$
Vertical girdle: $\lambda_{1}=0; \lambda_{2}=\lambda_3=1/2$

See :cite:t:`jordanModelingIceBirefringence2020` for an overview of the modeling introduced by :cite:t:`@fujitaSummaryComplexDielectric2000` and a nice summary of birefringence.
