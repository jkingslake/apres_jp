# Vector calculus background
Before we get going on deriving a model of ice sheet flow we will go over some fundamentals of vector calculus:
- scalar and vector fields
- the del operator
- gradients and divergence

## Fields

Fields are functions or variables that have a value defined at every point in space or time. Common fields in glaciology are temperature $T$, velocity $\underline{u}$, stress $\sigma$. These vary in the three spatial dimensions $x$, $y$, and $z$, and in time $t$.

### Scalar fields
Scalar fields are fields that only need one value in each location in space and time to define them. Examples are temperature $T$, ice-surface slope $S$, age $A$, and speed. 

We denote a scalar field simply as $T(x,y,z,t)$.

### Vector fields
Vector fields are more complicated. At each point in space and time, rather than just a scalar quantity we have a vector pointing in a specific direction in space. Therefore at each point in space and time, we require as many values as we have spatial dimensions. 

Examples of vector fields in glaciology are velocity $\underline{u}$, and the gradient of the ice-surface.

We denote vector fields with an underline and usually (at least when we first define them) write out their components, e.g.,

$$
\underline{u} = (u, v, w)
$$

These are typical symbols for the three velocity components used in glaciology, with $u$ as the horizontal component of velocity in the direction of the large scale flow of the ice sheet (i.e. along the $x$ axis), $v$ being the horizontal component perpendicular to this (i.e. along the $y$ axis), and $w$ being the vertical component (i.e. along the $z$ axis). Note the potential for confusion between the vector field $\underline{u}$ and its $x$-component $u$.

Each of the components are functions of space and time, so we could write the whole thing out verbosely as

$$
\underline{u}(x,y,z,t) = (u(x,y,z,t), v(x,y,z,t), w(x,y,z,t)).
$$

## The del operator
The del operator is a vector of differential operators. A differential operator can operate on functions and the result of the operation is a derivative of the function. 

In the case of del, we can think of it as a vector that has one component for each spatial dimension. So, for example, if we are considering a two-dimensional model, del has two components corresponding to these two directions. Each component is the differential operator corresponding to differentiation *in the corresponding direction*. So in two dimensions del is defined as 

$\underline{\nabla} = \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x} , \frac{\partial}{\partial y} \right)$

This notation with a comma in the middle is used to denote the two components of the vector $\frac{\partial}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial}{\partial y}$. Individually, these two components can each act on a scalar field and when they do they compute how the scalar field varies in the corresponding direction (i.e. its spatial gradient) . 

For example, if our ice sheet surface elevation is defined by the scalar field $h(x,y)$ (i.e. is it a function of our two coordinates $x$ and $y$), then the two components of del can individually act on $h$ giving us the gradients of $h$ in the two directions:  $\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial h}{\partial y}$. The gradients are themselves scalar fields because they vary in $x$ and $y$. 

### Gradient

Instead of having each component of del operate on our scalar field individually, we can simply write $\underline{\nabla} h$, which is the same as writing 

$\underline{\nabla}h = \left(\frac{\partial h}{\partial x} , \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} \right)$.

The gradients of $h$ in each direction (which, remember, are scalar fields) have been inserted in as the two components of the *vector* field $\underline{\nabla}h$. 
In other words, $\underline{\nabla}h$ is a vector field in which the $x$-component is $\frac{\partial h}{\partial x}$ and the $y$-component is $\frac{\partial h}{\partial y}$. 
This is referred to as the grad operator. In this particular case, when the grad operator is applied to the ice-sheet surface height, the result is a filed of vectors that each point in the direction of steepest ascent on the ice sheet surface. The length of these vectors is equal to the slope of the surface. 

### Divergence
Del is also useful for analyzing vector fields. One way to apply it to a vector field is to use the dot product. 
The dot product is the sum of the products of the components of two vectors. 
For example, for two vectors $\underline{A}$ and $\underline{B}$, each with components in the $x$ and $y$ direction denoted with subscripts ($A_x$, $A_y$, $B_x$, and $B_y$), the dot product is 

$$
\underline{A} \cdot \underline{B} = A_x B_x + A_y B_y
$$

Let's use a 2-D velocity field for our vector field $\underline{u} = (u,w)$.


Remembering that the $x$ and $y$ components of del are $\frac{\partial }{\partial x}$ and $\frac{\partial }{\partial y}$, we can write 

$$
\underline{\nabla} \cdot \underline{u} = \left(\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial w}{\partial z} \right).
$$

This is called the divergence of the velocity field. Later we will show using mass conservation that it is proportional to the rate of change of porosity, $\phi$:

$$
\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = (1- \phi) \underline{\nabla} \cdot \underline{u} 
$$

We usually assume that porosity is zero everywhere. In other words, we assume that in a bulk sense, the ice is incompressible. This means that we can usually assume 

$$
\underline{\nabla} \cdot \underline{u} =0, 
$$

which is very useful in many ice sheet modelling and data analysis tasks. Indeed, we use it in the heat flow chapter in the derivation of the heat equation.
